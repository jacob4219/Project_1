# This is my Read Me

Name:
The Man In The Machine

Description:
This is a game that I based loosely off of experiencing the "ilovebees.com" halo marketing campaign when I was young.
The game begins by opening up an oudated and barely functional "Virtual Desktop". 
By simply exploring what is interactive, functions are triggered and eventually the game begins.

The Game:
A man is mysteriously imprisoned in a machine. Help him escape by answering questions to unlock his prison.

Visuals
The entire thing is meant to be a mysterious experience. Moving through it without direction, happening upon things, is the general idea. A single background image was used and 5 icons to create a desktop experience.

Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Devlopment Plan
I sketched out the flow of the website on several sheets of paper, free hand.
